# inIT-OWL Datasets: Training Recommendation for PdM

Generated by `scripts/download_init_owl_datasets.py`. Manual ingest from Desktop: `scripts/ingest_kaggle_archives_from_desktop.py`.

## Manual ingest mapping (Desktop → project)

| Desktop folder   | Project path | Description |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **archive (1)**  | `data/downloads/kaggle/init_owl/bearing_condition_runs/` | Bearing condition runs: C7-1, C8, C9, C11, C13-*, C14, C15, C16. Columns: Timestamp, L_*, A_*, B_*, C_* (sensor channels). **Use for training**: RUL/condition classification. |
| **archive (2)**  | `data/downloads/kaggle/init_owl/industrial_control_timeseries/` | Industrial control/sensor CSV per run (pCut::, pSvolFilm::, pSpintor::). Includes `oneyeardata/` subdir. **Use for training**: equipment health / anomaly detection. |
| **archive (3)**  | `data/downloads/kaggle/init_owl/production_modules/` | Production/packaging modules: Delivery, Dosing, Filling_*, Production, Storage. **Use for training**: module-level failure or OEE-style metrics. |

To re-ingest from Desktop: `python scripts/ingest_kaggle_archives_from_desktop.py`.

## Summary

| Dataset | PdM score | Recommendation | Notes |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| bearing_condition_runs | 2 | **Use for training** | Sensor channels (L,A,B,C), timestamp. RUL/condition. |
| industrial_control_timeseries | 2 | **Use for training** | Motor/position/speed sensors, timestamp. Anomaly/RUL. |
| production_modules | 1 | Consider | Timestamp, state/flags (CupState, HeaterOn, Produce). Join with failures for targets. |

## PdM relevance

- **Score 2+**: Has sensor-like and target/failure-like (or time/asset) columns → good for failure prediction or RUL.
- **Score 1**: Partial (e.g. only sensors or only labels) → may need joining or preprocessing.
- **Score 0**: No obvious PdM columns in sampled CSVs → inspect manually if needed.
